### Abstract
The civil war, harsh climate, tough topography, and lack of accurate meteorological stations have limited observed dataacross Afghanistan. To fulfill the gap, this study analyzed the trend in precipitation and its extremes using Asian Precipita-tion Highly Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation (APHRODITE) daily dataset between 1951 and2010 at the spatial resolution of 0.25° × 0.25°. Non-parametric modified Mann-Kendall test and Sen’s slope estimator wereemployed to detect the trend and quantify it at the significance level of 5%. Significant decreasing trends were observedonly in small clusters of southwestern regions ranging between 0 and −1.5mm/year and the northeastern region between−1.5 and −6 mm/year for the annual time series. A similar trend pattern was observed in the spring season decreasing atthe rate of −0.15 and 0.54 mm/year in the northeastern and 0 to −0.15 mm/year southwestern region. A decrease in springprecipitation is expected to affect crop production especially in the northeastern region which hosts 22% of the arable area.An increasing trend in the eastern region at a maximum rate of 0.16 mm/year was observed which could intensify the flood-ing events. Trend analysis of extreme precipitation indices indicated similar spatial distribution to the mean precipitation,concentrated around southwestern, northeastern, and eastern regions. The increasing frequency of consecutive dry days inthe western region and very heavy precipitation (R10mm) and extremely heavy precipitation (R20mm) in the eastern regioncould be fueling the occurrence of droughts and floods respectively. Taking these findings of the erratic nature of rainfalland extreme events into consideration for sustainable management of water resources would be fruitful.

Standardized precipitation anomalies of annual precipitation for different ACRs of Afghanistan (1951–2010). Green, blue, and red lines indicate the threshold for drought severity classes (no drought: SPA >-0.84, moderate drought: -0.84>SPA>-1.28, severe drought: -1.28>SPA>-1.65 and extreme drought: SPA<-1.65)
